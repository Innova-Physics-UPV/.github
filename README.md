Innova Physics UPV is a multidisciplinary group of students interested in the fields of physics, engineering, and technology. Our mission is to design and build a neutron source to be applied in cancer therapy and diagnosis in a revolutionary and effective way. We work under the Generación Espontánea program, which is supported and funded by the Polytechnic University of Valencia. We believe in excellence and dedication, which allow us to advance day by day toward building a better future.
